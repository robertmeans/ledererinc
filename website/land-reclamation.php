		<h3>What is Land Reclamation?</h3>
		<p>Land reclamation is the process by which land is returned to a natural state after construction, mining or other man made influences have altered the environment. This can include hydromulching or hydroseeding, erosion control and any number of large scale restorative landscaping tactics.</p>

		<p>There are many environmental impacts to consider when staging a comprehensive reclamation project including drainage, erosion control, specific habitat attention and neighborhing population considerations. There are also dangers including soil compaction on filled land. These are all facets that the skilled team at Lederer, Inc. takes very seriously and will account for from our initial review.</p>

		<p>Lederer, Inc. manages land reclamation projects of all sizes with professional results. We would like the opportunity to show you how Lederer, Inc. can tailor a solution designed specifically for your unique project.</p>
